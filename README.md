# Face Recognition System üë®‚Äçüíº

This repository implements a face recognition system capable of identifying known faces in real time. It utilizes cutting-edge techniques for image processing and vector encoding, enabling fast and accurate facial identification.

 It consists of two files:
 
1. face_rec.py: Defines a class for encoding and detecting faces.

2. main.py: Implements the real-time face recognition system using a webcam.


# What is Face Recognition? ü§î

Face recognition is a biometric technology that identifies or verifies a person by analyzing facial features.

## üîç Core Processes

1. Face Detection: Locate faces in an image or video frame.

2. Feature Encoding: Convert the face into a numerical vector representation.

3. Face Matching: Compare encoded features with stored data to identify the person.

# How Face Recognition Works üöÄ

The face recognition system in this repository follows these steps:

## 1. Face Encoding

Each face is encoded into a numerical vector using a pre-trained model from face_recognition. This vector represents the unique features of the face, such as the distance between eyes, nose shape, and jawline.

Key Concept:

The encoding process is like creating a unique fingerprint for every face but in the form of a vector.

## 2. Comparison Using Distance Metrics
   
When a new face is detected, the system computes the distance between the new face's vector and the vectors of known faces in the database.

The system calculates the distance between this new embedding and the embeddings of known faces stored in the database.

Euclidean Distance (or sometimes Cosine Similarity) is a standard metric for comparing embeddings.

  ‚Ä¢ Euclidean Distance measures the straight-line distance between two points in the vector space.
  
  ‚Ä¢ Cosine Similarity measures the angle between two vectors, which can also be used depending on the application.

If the distance is below a certain threshold, the system determines that the face matches one in the database.

## 3. Thresholding

The threshold value is crucial:

Low threshold: Reduces false positives but might miss valid matches.
High threshold: Increases sensitivity but may lead to false matches.
For example:

Threshold = 0.3

If the distance = 0.2, the faces match.

If the distance = 0.7, the faces don‚Äôt match.
